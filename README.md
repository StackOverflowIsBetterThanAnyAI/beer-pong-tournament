# Beer Pong Tournament

## Organize your next Beer Pong Tournament!

-   Allow your participants to create an account and register a new team.
-   All teams are divided into random groups.
-   As an admin, you record all results and then display them to the participants in tabular form.
-   A tournament consists of a group stage and knockout stage.
-   Once a tournament has ended, it can either be restarted with the currently registered teams or restarted with completely reset progress.
